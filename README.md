# SMS-SPAM-Classification
Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages into spam and non-spam categories. This classification task is crucial in identifying and filtering out unwanted messages that are often sent for malicious or fraudulent purposes.
Dataset
We utilize a labeled dataset consisting of both spam and non-spam SMS messages. The dataset is sufficiently large and diverse, ensuring the robustness of our model's training process.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: We perform necessary preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization to prepare the raw data for training.
Feature Extraction: We extract relevant features from the preprocessed text using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
Model Selection: We experiment with different classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks to determine the most effective model for our task.
Model Training & Evaluation: We train the selected model on our labeled dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tune the hyperparameters of our chosen model to optimize its overall performance.
Final Model Deployment: After achieving satisfactory results during evaluation, we deploy the final trained model for predicting whether an incoming SMS message is spam or not.
Results
The effectiveness of our developed classifier will be assessed based on metrics achieved during evaluation such as accuracy percentage and other relevant measures.
Conclusion
By successfully building an accurate SMS spam classification model, we can help users filter out unwanted messages effectively and enhance their overall messaging experience by reducing exposure to potential scams or unsolicited advertisements.
